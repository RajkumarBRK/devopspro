SVN:
===
=>we have to manage repository manually and create an project inside repository
=>by using check-out , we can get files from repository to local machine
=>we have to commit your changes once development has been completed ,Because only commited files 
will be sending them into repository
=>by using check-in ,we can send files from local to repository
=>We can distribute only single files ,not for entair workspace
=>If any other developers want to get updated content in repository then we can take an update everytime

Limitations/con's
===================
=>your organization should respnsibilty to manage repository,So we have to recurit seperate admin for that
=>If we lost connectivty for server ,we can't send files into repository (online )
=>offline process is not possible 
=>we can't send/get entair workspace between client and server.
=>it is difficult to work sampe program for multiple users
